# First Shiny App in R - Titanic Survival Chances

### Description
My first R Shiny app is an interactive data visualization tool that provides insights into the survival chances of passengers aboard the Titanic during its voyage. 
Using a slice of data from the Titanic passengers, this app offers users the opportunity to explore and analyze survival rates based on various factors such as age, sex, passenger class, and embarkation port.
